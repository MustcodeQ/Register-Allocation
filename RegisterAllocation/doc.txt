Key Components
Constants and Data Structures:

NUM_REGISTERS and REGISTERS: Define the number of available registers and their names.
BasicBlock: Represents a basic block in the control flow graph (CFG) with an ID, a list of instructions, and sets for live-in and live-out variables.
InterferenceGraph: Represents the interference graph, where variables that cannot share the same register are connected by edges.
Interference Graph Construction:

createInterferenceGraph(const vector<BasicBlock>& blocks): This function constructs the interference graph. It iterates over the instructions in each basic block in reverse order and updates the live variable sets to establish interference edges between variables.
Register Allocation:

allocateRegisters(const InterferenceGraph& graph): This function allocates registers using a graph coloring algorithm:
Degree Calculation: Calculate the degree (number of neighbors) for each node (variable).
Simplification Phase: Remove nodes with a degree less than the number of available registers and push them onto a stack, decrementing the degree of their neighbors.
Select Phase: Pop nodes off the stack and assign them a register that is not used by their neighbors, ensuring no two adjacent nodes share the same register.
Main Function:

Example Basic Blocks: Defines a couple of basic blocks with instructions and live variable sets.
Graph Construction: Calls createInterferenceGraph to build the interference graph from the basic blocks.
Register Allocation: Calls allocateRegisters to perform register allocation based on the interference graph.
Output: Prints the register allocation results, showing which variable is assigned to which register.
Explanation of Each Part
Data Structures:

BasicBlock struct contains:
id: Identifier for the basic block.
instructions: List of variables involved in instructions.
liveIn and liveOut: Sets of variables that are live at the entry and exit of the block.
InterferenceGraph class contains methods to add edges and retrieve neighbors in the interference graph.
createInterferenceGraph:

Iterates through each basic block's instructions in reverse.
For each instruction (variable), updates the live variable set and adds edges between the variable and all variables in the live set (representing interference).
allocateRegisters:

Simplification Phase: Identifies nodes (variables) with fewer neighbors than available registers, removes them, and pushes them onto a stack.
Select Phase: Assigns registers to nodes popped from the stack, ensuring no adjacent nodes share the same register by checking the registers assigned to their neighbors.
Main Function:

Creates a few basic blocks with sample instructions and live variable sets.
Constructs the interference graph and allocates registers.
Prints the resulting register allocation.
